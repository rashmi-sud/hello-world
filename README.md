# hello-world
just a hello
All the world's a stage
and all men and women mearly actors
We cling on to false home with both arms
refusing to beleive the weightiest proofs against it
until it escapes
ripping our veins and draining our hearts blood. 
then regaining conciousness
we rush into the snares of delution all over again.
